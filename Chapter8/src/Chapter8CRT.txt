Chapter 8: CRT

Q1: Explain the difference between a has-a and is-a relationship among classes.
 A has-a relationship is a class that contains a class member's variables, while a is-a relationship is one that is derived from an existing class.

Q2: If a base class has a public method go() and a derived class has a public method stop(), which methods will be available to an object of  the derived class.
 Both classes would be available, as the object of the derived class is derived from the base class.

Q3: Compare and contrast implementing an abstract method to overriding a method.
An abstract method is a method that has been declared, but not implemented. Overriding a method is a subclass overriding a superclass.

Q4: Compare and contrast an abstract class to an interface.
An abstract class containing one or more abstract methods must be declared abstract. An interface with abstract methods, but cannot be inherited, but can be implemented by any number of classes. 

Q6: Use the following classes to answer the questions below:
What type of method is doThat() in Wo?
Assigns an int
What is Wo?
It is an interface
Why is DoThat() implemented in Roo?
It tells the method to return an int.
List the methods available to a Roo object.
doThis()
doNow()
How does the implementation of doThis() in Roo affect the implementation of doThis() in Bo?
It can confuse the code, and mistake one of the other methods.
What action does the statement super(1) in Roo perform?
Calls on the base class.
Can the doThis() method in Bo be called from a Roo object? If so, how?
No, because it does not call on the Roo object.
Can a method in Roo call the doThis() method in Bo? If so, how?
Yes, because it calls on Bo.
